## Overview
Robot tank design printed on a 3D printer, controlled via access point and incorporated Web page, using an ESP8266, an H bridge with two batteries, one with 3 18650 batteries to power the H bridge and the four generic motors, and the other with 3v for the ESP8266, its purpose was to walk on the street, or at home as a spy, however as it makes some noise, its purpose became accessing and filming difficult to access sites. It is all done in the 3d printer, made with a model of <a href ="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2527319">Thingerverse</a> the tank is able to travel outdoors at great speed, due to the battery consisting of three 18650. **The Project has WiFi and own dashboard**

## Configuration
-> Print 3D PARTS<br>
-> Build the Robot<br>
-> Install Arduino IDE<br>
-> <a href ="https://www.makerhero.com/blog/programar-nodemcu-com-ide-arduino/">Configure your Arduino IDE to ESP8266</a><br>
-> Choose the correct COM port<br>
-> Upload the code to ESP82666<br>

## How it works
- Press middle button to stop and receive new direction<br>
- Press front button to drive to front<br>
- Press back button to drive to rear<br>
- Press left button to rotate left<br>
- Press right button to rotate right<br>
**Note: If you press the same button several times, it will move in the same direction, more faster.**
