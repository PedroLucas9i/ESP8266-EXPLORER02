## Overview
Robot tank design printed on a 3D printer, controlled via access point and incorporated Web page, using an ESP8266, an H bridge with two batteries, one with 3 18650 batteries to power the H bridge and the four generic motors, and the other with 3v for the ESP8266, its purpose was to walk on the street, or at home as a spy, however as it makes some noise, its purpose became accessing and filming difficult to access sites. It is all done in the 3d printer, made with a model of <a href ="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2527319">Thingerverse</a> the tank is able to travel outdoors at great speed, due to the battery consisting of three 18650. **The Project has WiFi and own dashboard**

## Configuration
-> Print 3D PARTS
-> Build the Robot
-> Install Arduino IDE
-> <a href ="https://www.makerhero.com/blog/programar-nodemcu-com-ide-arduino/">Configure your Arduino IDE to ESP8266</a>
-> Choose the correct COM port
-> Upload the code to ESP82666

## How it works
Press middle button to stop and receive new direction
Press front button to drive to front
Press back button to drive to rear
Press left button to rotate left
Press right button to rotate right
**Note: If you press the same button several times, it will move in the same direction, more faster.**
